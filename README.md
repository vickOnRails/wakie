## Usage
> Wakie is not stable until version 1.0. This is my first mobile application, so things may not work as expected. But that doesn't mean you can't get your hands dirty yet!

clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vickOnRails/wakie.git
```

cd into directory and install dependencies

```bash
cd wakie && yarn 

or 

cd wakie && npm install
```

Start the expo cli

```bash
expo start
```

This will open `localhost:19002` on your default browser.

The quickest way to get started is to install the expo mobile app. After installing, open the app and scan the barcode. You should be set already.

If you have your emulator setup, you can start it, click on `Run on iOS simulator` / `Run on Android device`. This will launch the app on your emulator.

> You must have expo-cli installed before any of this would work
